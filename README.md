# Nim + Jester Rest API
Small proof of concept API to get familiar with Nim and Jester, using Docker. In addition, this effort is to build the smallest executable possible and run inside a Docker `scratch` container.

## Install
Clone and run `nimble install` to install all dependencies

## About
TBD

## Notes
* To get SSL support via static linking, I used a `config.nims` file found here: https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hello_musl
